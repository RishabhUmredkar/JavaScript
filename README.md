Hey buddies! 👋

Welcome to my **JavaScript Learning Notes** repo!  
I'm currently in the learning phase of **JavaScript**, and this is where I upload all my daily notes, code snippets, mini projects, and experiments.

Whether you're starting out or brushing up on core JS concepts, feel free to explore. These notes are meant to help me learn—and hopefully help you too! 😊
